# hello-world

This is Ben. Being a user for while. Figured I start making my mark, along with bettering my skills in coding. Far as I know, I'm geard towards Java and html.

Someday plan on created something akin to Online-Console.com (https://www.facebook.com/OnlineConsole, https://www.youtube.com/user/OnlineConsole/). Aim to not only preserve the console and handheld games (old and new), but to bring them to console gaming experince to the PC. For those that may lack said consols, this would provide an alternative.
